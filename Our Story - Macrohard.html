<h3>Here at Macrohard, we believe in overpricing our computers and services to the point that you need to sell one of your organs just to be able to afford a doors PC to the point people will consider Pineapple's WhopperBooks would be cheap. Our PCs are built very weakly to the point where touching it will break the entire PC. STOP!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!? ARE YOU TRYING TO RUN OUR COMPANY INTO THE GROUND?!?!?!? </h3>
